						<p class="portfolio-intro-content">Welcome to my ongoing research project on multivariate time 
							series forecasting of oil production. Please note that this project is currently under research
							 and has not been deployed yet.</p>
						
						<h3 class="portfolio-intro-title">Introduction</h3>
						<p class="portfolio-intro-content">This project focuses on developing a forecasting model for oil
							 production using advanced machine learning techniques and optimization algorithms. The project
							  includes the development of a Genetic Algorithm-Temporal Convolutional Neural Network-Long 
								Short-Term Memory (GA-TCN-LSTM) ensemble model, as well as benchmarking against conventional
								 models such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
								  and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN).</p>
						<p class="portfolio-intro-content">Additionally, the project includes exploratory data analysis and 
							data cleaning using our custom-built odc module.
							The module is designed to detect, visualize, and treat outliers in oil well datasets and is readily
							 available in the <a href="https://github.com/ashrafalaghbari/odc">odc repository</a>.</p>
						
						<h3 class="portfolio-intro-title">Motivation</h3>
						<p class="portfolio-intro-content">Accurate oil production forecasting is of paramount importance for oil and gas companies, governments,
							 and policy-makers. It enables informed decision-making regarding production rates, inventory management,
							  and revenue estimation.</p>
						<p class="portfolio-intro-content">Conventional forecasting methods often fall short in capturing
							 the complexities and dynamic changes inherent in oil production systems. To address this challenge,
							  I have incorporated advanced machine learning techniques and optimization algorithms.
								 By leveraging these tools, I aim to capture the intricacies of the system and identify
								  the optimal combination of hyperparameters for each model. My ultimate goal is to
									 provide decision-makers with reliable information that enhances the forecasting process 
									 and improves decision-making.</p>
						<p class="portfolio-intro-content">Please note that this project is still in the research phase,
							 and the results and conclusions are subject to further analysis and refinement.
							  I appreciate your interest and invite you to explore my portfolio to learn more about this
								 project and other research endeavors I am currently involved in. Stay tuned for updates as I 
								 continue to enhance the accuracy and reliability of oil production forecasting.</p>
